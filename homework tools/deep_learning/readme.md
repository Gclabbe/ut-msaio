# Utility functions and modifications to the provide test routines
## It is important to accept that these are my changes to the provided files
## They worked for me and helped me work on solutions to the problems
## YMMV and I am not to be trusted when it comes to packaging and checking in your code

# All homework / solution code has been removed from each file.  If you find any code you believe
# is giving hints to problem solutions, please let know so I can avoid breaking the honor code
# while trying be helpful to fellow students.

# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

Although, hopefully they help you as much as they helped me.
